I would opt for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deep learning model for detecting size mismatches in pairs of footwear due to their exceptional ability to process image-based data effectively. 
By training a CNN for binary classification (matched or mismatched pairs), the model can learn to distinguish between correctly paired shoes and instances where different sizes are mistakenly paired. 
CNNs are designed to automatically learn intricate patterns and features from images, making them ideal for tasks like identifying differences in shoe sizes. 


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
CNNs are a class of deep learning models primarily used for image recognition and processing tasks.

It's architecture is divided into 3 parts:-
Convolutional Layer:
The convolutional layer is the fundamental building block of CNNs.
It performs convolution operations on input data using learnable filters or kernels.
Convolution involves sliding the filter over the input data, performing element-wise multiplication, and summing the results to produce feature maps.

Pooling Layer:
The pooling layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of feature maps while retaining important information.
Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.
Max pooling retains the maximum value within a defined pool size, effectively capturing the most salient features.
Average pooling calculates the average value within the pool, which can help in achieving spatial invariance and reducing overfitting.
Pooling helps in reducing computational complexity, controlling overfitting, and improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.
Output Layer:
The output layer is the final layer in a CNN and is responsible for producing the network's predictions or outputs.
We will have 2 neurons in output layer since we need to perform binary classification i.e 0 or 1 non matched or matched.

The output layer's neurons represent the class probabilities, and the predicted class is often the one with the highest probability.
